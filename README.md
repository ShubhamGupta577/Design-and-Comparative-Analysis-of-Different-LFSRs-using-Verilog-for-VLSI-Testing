# :part_alternation_mark: Design-and-Comparative-Analysis-of-Different-LFSRs-using-Verilog-for-VLSI-Testing
<h2>:memo:  About project</h2>
LFSRs are highly important in digital systems nowadays and are used in many different ways. LFSRs are simple, efficient, and can produce pseudo-random bit sequences.
The aim of this project  is to design and analyse various LFSR‚Äôs performances to test stuck at faults for a circuit under test. We have analysed parameter like clock period required and test patterns generated required for the circuit to test its faults. All the design and implementation of different LFSRs was done using Verilog language and EDA playground.

In this project, there are 3 types for LFSR are taken as following:
- **Primitive Polynomial LFSR** :- Primitive polynomial LFSRs are a specific type that utilize a feedback polynomial that is considered primitive. These LFSRs are known for their ability to generate maximum-length sequences, with a period equal to 2^N - 1, where N represents the number of bits in the register. By using a primitive polynomial, these LFSRs ensure that every nonzero state within the register is visited during its cycle, resulting in a highly random. In our design we had taken the `x^4+x+1` polynomial.
- **Bit Swapping LFSR** :-  In bit swapping LFSR, instead of shifting the bits in a linear fashion, specific bits within the shift register are swapped or exchanged. This swapping operation introduces a non-linear behavior, which can enhance the randomness and statistical properties of the generated sequence.
- **Bit Reversal LFSR** :- Bit-reversal LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) refers to a specific type of LFSR where the output sequence is generated by shifting the register contents to the left and using the feedback from the least significant bit (LSB) as the input to the most significant bit (MSB). This results in the output sequence being the bit-reversal of the LFSR's internal state

<h2> üõ†Ô∏è Tools and peripherals used</h2>

In this project all the peripherals are simulated. Softwares and serivces used in this project are:
- **EDA Playground** :- This platform is used to write and get the various waveform results of the verilog code.


<h2> Circuit Under Test</h2>
For the purposes of this test, the selected circuit is a combination of AND, NAND and NOR gate. By focusing on this circuit, we aim to analyse its behaviour, identify potential issues, and assess its overall performance under specific test conditions.
Here is the Circuit which is used for Testing

<h3>Test Vectors</h3>

| Fault | Test Vectors{a,b,c,d} |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| e_iO Stuck-at 0 | {0,0,x,x},{0,1,x,x},{1,0,x,x} |
| e_iO Stuck-at 1  |{1,1,x,x}  |
|F0_iO Stuck-at 0 | {x,x,0,0}|
|F0_iO Stuck-at 1 |{x,x,0,1},{x,x,1,0},{x,x,1,1}|
|g_iO Stuck-at 0 | {0,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{1,0,0,0}|
|g_iO Stuck-at 1| {1,1,0,1},{1,1,1,0},{1,1,1,1}|

#### Test vectors using Dominance: [{1,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0}].
